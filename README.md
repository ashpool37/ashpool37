# Hi, my name is Artem.

I'm a DevOps with programming and cybersecurity backgrounds. I'm passionate for [Free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and [Open Source](https://opensource.org/osd) software, self-hosted infrastructure, and decentralized systems.

Based in Serbia since 2022 :serbia:.

# I'm looking for work.

Contact me using your preferred method:

My homepage is at https://ash.pw, but for now there's not much to see.

Since I'm between jobs, I might be interested to help you for free if you have an open source project that I like.

## Linux

My Linux journey began circa 2012. I've hopped many distros as daily drivers over the years, including some niche ones like Gentoo and Alpine, but I've landed on Arch Linux for now as a compromise between simplicity, flexibility, and mainstream support.

I haven't touched a Windows computer in years and I'm not planning to, but I'm open to buying a Mac if I ever need to do some creative heavy lifting (video editing, music production, graphic design, etc).

I'm not into the Unix ricing scene, although I appreciate it. I customize my environment just enough to get the job done with minimal suffering. My dotfiles and scripts are in [dotfiles](https://github.com/ashpool37/dotfiles).
